Bot or Not?
============

Bot or Not? is a design project for the Graphic Design and Visual Experience M.F.A. program at the Savannah College of Art and Design. This exercise was part of Project 2, Dynamic Display of Dynamic Data in the course GDVX 754: Curated Narrative for Dynamic Content.

The goal of this project is to challenge assumptions about artificial intelligence. The quiz walks the participant through 10 true/false questions asking whether various pieces of art, music, and other snippets are human generated or A.I. generated. In addition, at the beginning and end of the quiz, the participant is asked to rank their favorability of A.I. with the intent of measuring whether A.I. favorability increases or decreases after taking the quiz. 

A longer form version of this project would capture participant responses over time and attempt to measure A.I. favorability over time.
